## Version Control
> Version control also known as revision control or source control, is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

- One of the popular version controlling software is `Git`


## Why version control
- Collaboration
- Helps to understand what happened
- Storing & Restoring Versions
- Backup
- Many more


## Git Basics
> Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It can be used to keep track of changes in any files.

> I highly recommend playing this game to learn more about git [https://try.github.io](https://try.github.io)

Note: Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.



## Follow these basic commands

- Create new directory 
```
$ mkdir puliya
$ cd puliya
```


## Git basics
- To initialize a Git repository
```
$ git init
```

- Create a text file with sample content

```
$ echo "git is awesome" > test.txt
```

- Then check the status of the repository

```
$ git status
```

- Add the file to version control

```
$ git add test.txt
```


## Git basics [contd.]
- Check the status
```
$ git status
```

- Commit the changes to the repository
```
$ git commit -m "added initial test.txt file"
```

- Check the status once again
```
$ git status
```


## Git basics [contd.]
- Add different data into `test.txt` file
```
$ echo "this is different content" > test.txt
$ git status
$ git add test.txt
$ git status
$ git commit -m "updated test.txt file with random content"
$ git status
```


## Git basics [contd.]
- Now let's browse them to see what we changed.
```
$ git log
```

- Add little more content
```
$ echo "this is different content from previous" > test.txt
```

- Look at the differences
```
$ git diff
```


## Git basics [contd.] (Not required here)
- To push to remote repository from local, add the remote repository
```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
```

- Push the changes to remote repository
```
$ git push -u origin master
```

- To pull the changes
```
$ git pull origin master
```


## Git basics [contd.] (Not required here)
- To clone a git repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/madhuakula/null-puliya-adpk-markdown.git
```

## Introducing [Reveal JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)
- A framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML

> `reveal.js` comes with a broad range of features including nested slides, Markdown contents, PDF export, speaker notes and a JavaScript API. There's also a fully featured visual editor and platform for sharing reveal.js presentations at slides.com.


## How to automated Markdown to Presentation(reveal.js) using reveal-md
**What is reveal.md?**
> reveal.js on steroids! Get beautiful reveal.js presentations from your Markdown files

- `reveal-md` is a nodejs tool to convert and preview `reveal.js` presentations using markdown


## reveal-md demo
- Open sublime and create new file and paste the below content and save with `.md` extension
    + For examples `presentation.md`

```
# Title

* Point 1
* Point 2

---

## Second slide

> Best quote ever.

Note: speaker notes FTW!
```


## reveal-md demo [Contd.]
- Now open your terminal and type the below command. Make sure the md file path is `presentation.md` (your markdown file) correct.

```
$ reveal-md ~/Documents/presentation.md
```

- Now it will automatically open this in your favourite browser.
- Press `s` to see the speaker view

Note: If time permits, we can do simple exercises


## reveal-md demo [Contd.]
- To print the presentation, run the below command
```
$ reveal-md ~/Documents/presentation.md --print ~/Documents/presentation.pdf
```

## Knowledgebase
- A store of information or data that is available to draw on.

> A knowledge base (KB) is a technology used to store complex structured and unstructured information used by a computer system.


## Why Knowledgebase

> Writing documentation is very important and keeping it updated and available everyone in the organisation is difficult with traditional methods. Knowledgebase allows to have a centralised place to look for all the documentation, how-to guides, playbooks, many more. It will also help us to write (or) generate more content for articles, blog posts, reference material, etc.


## Introducing [Raneto](http://raneto.com/)

> Raneto is a Knowledgebase platform for Node.js that uses static Markdown files to power the knowledgebase.
![Raneto KB](images/raneto-kb.png)


## Raneto [Contd.]
Raneto can be called a "static site generator" of sorts as it doesn't require a database. All of your content is stored in the content folder in Markdown (.md) files and the entire knowledgebase structure and content is generated by Raneto. This is good because it's:

- Simple: You can create and manage an entire knowledge base using your favourite text editor
- Flat: Raneto is a "flat file" CMS, meaning no database woe's, no MySQL queries, nothing
- Fast: Raneto is seriously lightweight and doesn't use a database, making it super fast


## Let's start Raneto server
- Navigate to the `Raneto` directory
```
$ cd /home/ubercool/Raneto
```

- Start the `Raneto` server by running the below command
```
$ npm start
```

- Then navigate to [http://localhot:3000](http://localhot:3000) in your favourite browser


## How to add content to the knowledgebase?
- We have to write our `Markdown` files and keep them under content folder
- For example, run the below command open sublime with `null-puliya.md` under content folder in another terminal window
```
$ subl /home/ubercool/Raneto/example/content/null-puliya.md
```

- Then paste the below `Markdown` text and save the file
