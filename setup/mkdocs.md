### Installing MkDocs

[MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

- To install `MkDocs` we need to have `python` and `pip` follow the below instructions
    + In most of the Linux operating systems `python` is installed by default. So I'm skipping installation of `python`

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install mkdocs
```
